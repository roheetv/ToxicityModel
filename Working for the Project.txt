# Comment Toxicity Detection using Deep Learning and NLP

This project focuses on building a comment toxicity detection system using Deep Learning techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal of this system is to automatically identify and flag toxic or harmful comments in various online platforms such as social media, discussion forums, and comment sections. The project also includes a deployment of the model in a Gradio app for interactive usage.

## Key Features

- Utilizes state-of-the-art Deep Learning models for comment toxicity detection.
- Applies advanced NLP techniques to process and analyze textual data.
- Detects different types of toxic content, including but not limited to hate speech, insults, threats, and offensive language.
- Provides accurate and efficient classification of toxic comments, enabling effective moderation and content filtering.
- Offers a user-friendly Gradio app interface for real-time toxicity detection on custom comments.
- Facilitates easy integration with existing online platforms for seamless moderation.

## How it Works

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - Gather a large dataset of comments with manually labeled toxic/non-toxic annotations.
   - Perform data preprocessing steps such as tokenization, normalization, and removing stopwords.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Model Development:
   - Employ Deep Learning architectures, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer models, to learn patterns from text data.
   - Train the model using the labeled training dataset and optimize hyperparameters.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics on the testing dataset.

3. Deployment using Gradio:
   - Build a Gradio app to provide an interactive interface for users.
   - Integrate the trained toxicity detection model into the Gradio app.
   - Enable users to input their own comments for toxicity analysis and receive real-time feedback on the detected toxicity level.
